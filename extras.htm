<h3>God of Storms</h3>
<p>Your Dream is of eternal turbulence, of calm seas one moment and hurricanes the next. Mortals beseech you to for safe travel, for good harvest, for rain in times of drought, and for you to curse their enemies. Do you accept their sacrifices? Do you even care about mortalkind?</p>

<h3>God of Suffering</h3>
<p>Your Dream is of a bleak landscape that stretched for eternity, where the souls of those who failed both themselves and you toil endlessly in hopes of earning your divine forgiveness. But can anything ever truly redeem such pathetic beings?</p>
<img src="img/extras/godOfSuffering.png" width="661">

<h3>God of Protection</h3>
<p>Your Dream is of a perfect alabaster and marble world, one without wind or rain, where nothing is ever marred. Mortals remain statues, frozen in poses that best represents their lives. When they beg for release, what is your cruel reply?</p>
<img src="img/extras/godOfProtection.png" width="661">

<h3>God of Retribution</h3>
<p>Your Dream is of a perfectly just world, one where violence begets never-ending violence and no slight goes unpunished—not just for mortals, but the very spirits of nature are always on trial. Everyone begs forgiveness; what is sentence for that most unholy of crimes?</p>

<h3>God of Sacrifice</h3>
<p>Your Dream is of a throne build upon the bodies of those fallen in your name—your armies and those slaughtered by them. Servants forever bring to you bounties mortals pledge in return for your favor. But can a mortal who has yet to die for you truly be worthy of any boon?</p>

<h3>God of the Night</h3>
<p>Your Dream is of eternal darkness, where mortals live in fear of its denizens—dire wolves, the undead, and other monsters. They beg you for even a hint of moonlight, and cry in agony when denied it. Do you delight in their plight, or is your heart to cold even for that?</p>

<hr>

<p>Your life was simple—hunting, farming, trading, growing up on the streets—until one chance encounter with adventurers left you awed. After that, your life was empty and hollow; only by throwing yourself into constant danger and returning triumphant would you ever again feel alive.</p>

<hr>
