Super-quick notes on how to build this...

1. Run 'bundle exec compass watch' in a terminal to automaticall rebuild css/app.css when you make changes to the SASS files
2. Run 'make' to apply the template to the bare .htm files and copy everything (images, css, js, html, other) into place
3. Run 'grunt' to minify the css, and run 'make' again to copy it into place.
