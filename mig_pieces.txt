The <span class="gameKeyword">Corrupter</span> upgrade for <span class="gameKeyword">One More Breath</span> allows the god to corrupt all Mythenders upon being Ended by paying <span class="gameKeyword">5 Might tokens</span> each. For the one who Ended him, it only costs <span class="gameKeyword">2 Might tokens</span>.

The <span class="gameKeyword">Bottomless</span> upgrade for <span class="gameKeyword">Bloodlust</span> allows you to, once per battle, gain the effects of the Gift (including <span class="gameKeyword">Dangerous</span>) at no cost.
