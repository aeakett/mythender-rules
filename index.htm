<p>Here you&rsquo;ll find the complete rules for Ryan Macklin&rsquo;s Mythender RPG.</p>

<p>This site is completely unofficial, and unaffiliated with Ryan Macklin or the Mythender RPG. For the official Mythender site, please visit <a href="http://mythenderrpg.com">MythenderRPG.com</a>. Also be sure to check out <a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/">Ryan&rsquo;s site</a>, where he writes about all sorts of good stuff (including, but certainly not limited to Mythender).</p>

<p>Mythender exists because some awesome people put together a fundraising effort for a friend with cancer, and another bunch of awesome people gave their hard-earned cash (<a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/rke-bundle/">read the whole story here</a>). If you enjoy this game, you might consider making a donation to a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cancer+charity">cancer-related charity</a>, or visit the official Mythender site and drop some cash in the tip jar there.</p>
