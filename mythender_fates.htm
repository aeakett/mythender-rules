<p>Your Dream is filled with the wailing of troubled souls. Their prayers are filled with anguish. They offer sacrifice for an audience, seeking justice or mercy. Does your word bring them order? Peace? Regret?</p>

<h3 id="thedreamofchaos">The Dream of Chaos</h3>

<h2 id="makingnewfates"><span class="bigger">M</span>AKING <span class="bigger">N</span>EW <span class="bigger">F</span>ATES</h2>

<p>Fates are vastly different from Hearts and Pasts, because they’re more esoteric. Because of that, they aren’t filled with questions to answer, but options to choose from and alter to taste. The easy way to make a new Fate is to change the Personal Blights and Forms on one of the Fate’s options. Many people do this—and that’s great!</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you’re making a new Fate from scratch, you’ll need to know if you’re making a broad Fate or a narrow one. The six in this book are broad; you can tell this because there are two different takes for each one, which are only unified by the overall theme (reflected in the Heart’s Dream and its nebulous questions) and the Fate’s Power Over Mortals. A Fate with only one strong interpretation that you can see is a narrow Fate, though over time it may become broader.</p>

<p>Key to making a Fate is making sure it’s inhuman and at best only slightly sympathetic. The God of Blacksmiths, for instance, isn’t just some dude who likes to work all day over hot metal, but a deity that abhors freeloaders and those who do not contribute to civilization—those people erode his power. The God of Hedonism isn’t just someone who likes to party, but one who <em>needs</em> mortals to engage in gluttony and debauchery, as that is his true food and drink.</p>

<p>When making a Fate, understand that the Fate’s Power Over Mortals exists for three reasons: to tell you what your Mythender can do that others can’t, to show you how your Mythender is pretty much already that god right now and should just give into Fate, and to give you and the Mythmaster ideas for Terrorizing Mortals for Power. Similarly, the Personal Blight exists as a tool for the Mythmaster to remind the Mythender at every turn that she’s not entirely mortal—<em>especially</em> when she’s trying to Seek Sympathy and Healing.</p>

<p>The only advice I can give on making specific Personal Blights, Forms, and Power have already been said in <a href="creating_your_mythender.htm#damningyourmythender">Damning Your Mythender</a>. Look at the Fates in this book as examples for tone. Keep the Forms about appearance, not about how mortals feel—that’s key to making a Personal Blight function in the story, as well as making Terrorizing Mortals the Mythender’s choice rather than an accident based on the current Form.</p>
